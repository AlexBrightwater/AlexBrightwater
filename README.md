Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile,
I am a GNU+Linux enthusiast. I love everything related to comuters and am heavily interested into selfhosting as much stuff as I can.
Also I like minecraft and am the creator of Super Visual, a modrinth Modpack as well as Rinth DL which is a modrinth modpack downloader.
